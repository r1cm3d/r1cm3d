I'm a software engineer with a passionate for operational systems, system programming languages, networks and high load distributed systems.

I'm currently interested in AWS Cloud Computing, thus I've been studying a lot for take [SAA-C02](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) exam. I already have [CLF-C01](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) and [DVA-C01](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) certifications.
Besides that, I crazy about system programming languages, network and OSes. This is the reason that I working on to take [LPIC-1 101](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/exam-101-objectives) exam. After made [LPI Essentials](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/linux-essentials-overview), this is the natural next step. The last but not least, I've deep diving into [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/) in my toy projects at my Github, as you may see in the following list:

- [dynhdl](https://github.com/r1cm3d/dynhdl): DYNamo HanDLer is a tiny CLI application to handle DynamoDB DML requests for a configured table wrote in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/r1cm3d/dotfiles): It contains my configuration files (dotfiles). Besides that, it also has my own functions, aliases and environment variables;
- [ppsch](https://github.com/r1cm3d/ppsch): This shellscript receives a file (stdin or by argument) and increases TTL attribute for a given DynamoDB table;
- [cards](https://github.com/r1cm3d/cards): A [RESTful](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiioqKBmYvvAhX7JrkGHVy4DTcQFjABegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRepresentational_state_transfer&usg=AOvVaw0OzDaMKoo_WiXymUEv7kQr) [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) web server that handles credit/debit cards;
- [aws-poc](https://github.com/r1cm3d/aws-poc): A [Go](https://golang.org/) application that use some AWS resources among [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language;
